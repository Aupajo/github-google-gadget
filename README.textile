h1. GitHub Google Gadget

An iGoogle gadget for displaying GitHub repositories.

Works fine, but currently only works with the new <b>gadgets.*</b> api, which is closed to developers.

%{color:red}Currently, to use it, you need to be using the "iGoogle Developer's Sandbox":http://www.google.com/ig/sandbox.%

A legacy api port will be coming soon for the general public.

You can test out the gadget by adding:

"http://labs.metanation.com/github-google-gadget/gadget.xml":http://labs.metanation.com/github-google-gadget/gadget.xml

You should be able to use this link to insta-add it (no guarantees):

"http://www.google.co.nz/ig/adde?hl=en&moduleurl=http://labs.metanation.com/github-google-gadget/gadget.xml&source=imag":http://www.google.co.nz/ig/adde?hl=en&moduleurl=http://labs.metanation.com/github-google-gadget/gadget.xml&source=imag
